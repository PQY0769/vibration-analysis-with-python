# vibration-analysis-with-python
use python to learn vibration analysis like impact responsed and FFT review

import timewave file PP-20045 -190117-083330-X114002196-3000-timewave.txt

gain frequency result in labview like labview fft.png

use FFT.txt to gain frequency result like python fft.png, where range is worng.
use fft2.txt to gain frequency result like python fft.png, where hz is worng.
use trend.txt to plot multiple curves in same picture and faile to scribe the time axi.
